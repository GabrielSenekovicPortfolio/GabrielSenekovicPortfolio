<h2>About Me</h2>

I am a programmer that does C#, C++ and C. My tool of trade has been Unity, which is what I'm most comfortable with, but I've also worked with OpenGL directly and with SDL. I love making games, and it's been my path since I was very small, playing the family NES and SNES and analysing our Super Mario Bros 3 guidebook and trying to draw my own levels. Naturally due to this background, my "niche" is retrogames, but I do love a wide variety of games.

My favourites include Kingdom Hearts, Deltarune, Hades, Genshin Impact, Noita and Civ 6.

<h2>History</h2>

I've been programming since 2017, and went to study Game Design with a minor in Programming at Uppsala University on Gotland in 2019.

There I learned how to program in C++, how to use OpenGL, SDL and code shaders. I also learned linear algebra and the game production pipeline in depth.

2022 I graduated and started my internship at King at the end of the same August. I spent my time working there until the end of February 2023.

In fall 2023 I started another internship at Edtech Studios. It was ended in January when I got probational employment at Short Circuit Studios in February 2024 where I ported a game to Steam and was part of my first release. Tiny Connections.
