            Squid hooking the ceiling when in water no longer makes you fall through the universe
            You no longer bounce away in the opposite direction when you let go of the squid hook after reeling in
            Niyo now turns around toward the direction you are shooting the squid hook
            Your jump no longer gets reset by the squid hook even when you miss
            The cane animation has been redrawn to no longer use placeholder graphics
            The cane hitbox has been adjusted
            The waterfalls now put out fire
            Niyo should no longer climb in the air, facing the wrong direction
            Fixed the credits being unreadable
