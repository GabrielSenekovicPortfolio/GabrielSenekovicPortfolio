    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>Yarn Knight was a project that started as an entry for a Game Jam, where I wanted to experiment with programming concepts I hadn’t had a chance to delve deeper into previously, such as lambda functions and switch expressions. I also wanted to try to make a smaller concept than previously that would be easy to “finish” as well as easily expandable in case I so wished.

I also looked further into Unity’s shader graph, and made both the vignette “in and out” effect when you win a level, as well as a palette swap shader, the effects of which you can witness as you go between worlds.

Having an interest in Binding of Isaac, a twin stick shooter was something I was interested in tackling eventually, so this is my own example of this genre.
