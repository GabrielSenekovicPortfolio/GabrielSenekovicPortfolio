    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>In the second year of university, we were tasked with making a Vertical Slice for the end-of-the-year project. A Vertical Slice is like a tiny portion of a game that you polish as much as possible, in order to showcase what the game could be.

For the project, I was the product owner and one of the three programmers. With these roles, I coordinated the other programmers as well as the art direction and composed the soundtrack.

This project came with a lot of pressure to get everything finished in time and to both feel good and be different from other games in the genre. We set out to make a game where you’d be able to spend a lot of time midair, but we weren’t quite able to get the hookshot to feel that good yet. We still have plans to get back to it and fix it however. I learned a lot from this project in terms of mouse and aiming coordination on a 2D plane, controller schemes in Unity and how to use the shaders and VFX graphs.
