            We are intending to release more cards, including item cards and event cards, as well as implementing the energy and burst functionalities.
            We also want to have a way to get a closeup of a card to examine it, by using the mouse middle click.
            There needs to be a main menu you get when you open the game, as well as a pause menu with settings and a controller scheme.
            More tooltips are required, such as for attacks.
            We also need to vectorise the icons, and implement the story, including both talksprites and dialog.

        <td>The initial version handed in for the Game Jam. It had dice rolling, the card hand and placing creature cards. However, it really only had creature cards, and no attack animations. Thus it was almost impossible to tell what was going on. The mechanics were there, but barely any UX. The dice box and table were also there.
        This version laid the foundation, but could barely be called a functional game. It was only a few small steps away from being finished, however.</td>
