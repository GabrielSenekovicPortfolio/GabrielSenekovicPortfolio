        <td>The initial version handed in for the Game Jam. It had dice rolling, the card hand and palcing creature cards. However, it really only had creature cards, and no attack animations. Thus it was almost impossible to tell what was going on. The mechanics were there, but barely any UX. The dice box and table were also there.
        This version laid the foundation, but could barely be called a functional game. It was only a few small steps away from being finished, however.</td>
