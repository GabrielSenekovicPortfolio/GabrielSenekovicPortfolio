    <h2>Description</h2>
    Queer Cards: Dice and Demis is a TCG-style cardgame inspired by Genius Invocation TCG, Pokemon TCg and Magic: The Gathering. You take turns rolling dice that you use as energy, then play cards based on that energy. You place creature cards, then use them to attack the opponents creatures. The game ends when either of you are out of creatures.

   <h2>Background</h2>
    Queer Cards: Dice and Demis was a game made for the BigMode Game Jam 2025 for the theme of "power". We went through a lot of ideas for howw to implement "power" into the mechanics. Since it was really quite vague, it was difficult. Being a team of gay people and on a time crunch, we went for "Gay power" and a narrative of a gay main character playing cards for the right to get married. The idea was that each card type was one of the stripes of the rainbow pride flag, and that the opponents would only play with gray "bigot type" cards. Halfway through the battle, their cards would also turn colorful, and you'd find out they're repressing their own identity.

    When making this game, I decided to take on more 3D modeling and learn Blender properly. I had used Blender previously, but never made anything as big as the table that the cards are being played on. I also tried to make a simple, modular code framework that could be used for any types of card games, and with the possibility of being extended to board games.
