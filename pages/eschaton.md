    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>Eschaton is a 2D sandbox game where you can break blocks. At the current moment, there are only biomes one chunk big each, no enemies, and only the functionality to break blocks and place them. However, this will be one of those projects I continuously update as I go.
The game was conceived as a Terraria clone in a loose sense. I wanted to make a game using C++ and SDL for my portfolio to prove my ability to program in C++ for future job applications. At the same time, I was thinking about how Terraria could handle so many blocks at the same time in such a large world, which I wanted to try my hand at replicating. And so I got to work on this project.
