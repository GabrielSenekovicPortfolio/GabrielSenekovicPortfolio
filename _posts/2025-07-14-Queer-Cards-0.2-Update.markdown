Since me and Jasper were both in need of better portfolios, and it would be nice to have something more or less finished, we decided to keep working on Queer cards. I’ve worked with Jasper on many projects, where I've made him do animations and pixel art. Seeing the art he makes in his freetime, though, I thought it might go fastest if I made him do splash-art style pieces. That's part of why making cards was a good idea, but we would also be able to make billboarded opponent characters, which is a plan for the future. We will also set up a google questionnaire where you can provide feedback on the different parts of the game as well as the art, so that we can improve upon this small contained experience.
<br><br>
To commemorate the release of this update, I’ve also created a page of the website with a list of all the cards of the game along with who the artist to each card is. With that same website update, I release changelog pages for each project and a general update. This way, you’ll be able to see an entire list of all of the changes made to the game for this update, on this link here.
<br><br>
With this, I hope I can better and more thoroughly display my work and experience
