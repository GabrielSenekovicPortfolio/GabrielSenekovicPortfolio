Hello!

After getting fed up with having my portfolio on Wordpress, a website that is very obnoxious to work with, I found out about Github pages! This has been my first time making a website by myself, and thus, I have mostly been following tutorials and haphazardly put together this website like patchwork. However, that is not to imply that I haven't learned anything new! I have a better understanding of the relationship between css, html and javascript now, and have seen much more what is and what isn't possible to do. And honestly, it makes me question what even was Wordpress issue? Perhaps they just wanted to push my frustration until I decided to pay for their subscription? But I am way too stingy to fall for that, I'm afraid. So here we are.
<br><br>
As things are right now on the website, it is far from finished. There are placeholder sprites around the place, there are still no screenshots available for the projects, and the main page is not much to look at. However, I needed to get this portfolio finished so I could start writing blog posts and also use it for job hunting (because my wordpress portfolio kinda broke)
<br><br>
Anyway, in other news, I recently took part in the 2024 Yogscast game jam! I'm dropping da linky right here:

<br><br>
My game was/is called "The Purgatory of Greed", and is a turnbased combat roguelite, because I simply cannot help myself but to create a new roguelite whenever I get the oppurtunity. I've been told it's fun to play, even though I didn't get to put in all the mechanics that I wanted... But I intend to fix that as soon as my japanese course is over with. The game is pretty solid, with only one game breaking bug that has been found. Not bad for a game made in one week by one person. The code is kind of haphazardly put together (thank you Zenject and DoTween), but it works and it was nice to do something I haven't tried before (turn based combat, and not using pixel art for once). Please take a look if you're interested. I hope to make a longer post about it in the future.
