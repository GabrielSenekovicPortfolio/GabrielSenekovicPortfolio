Me and Jasper have been taking part in another game jam! This time, it was this jam that we took part in: 
<a href="https://itch.io/jam/speed-run-jam/results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jam Link</a>, a ten day long game jam hosted by 8 bits to infinity. They host game jams several times per year, and this one was their 47th jam in total. This was the first time that I took part in one of their jams, although I’ve been wanting to for quite a while. I am still regretful about missing the 8bit jam, and I’ve been meaning to backtrack through the previous jams and playtest previous winners sometime.
<br><br>
Anyway, I had wanted to make some sort of civ-like game for quite a while in order to go deeper into hexagonal maps. During my time with Short Circuit Studios, I implemented the hexagonal maps into “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2715700/Teeny_Tiny_Town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teeny Tiny Towns</a>”, and thought it was a lot of fun. I thought, I should make something myself with what I learned there. An idea I had had for a while, is a map you “build” yourself by placing hexagonal cards on preplaced tiles. I’ve rerolled this idea several times in my mind, balling with my friends who like turn-based strategy games. When this gamejam came around, I thought it a good opportunity to make a prototype in order to see what I might prefer.
<br><br>
I obviously had to make it speedrunnable, and the theme was “Nature”, so the idea was to make a game where you have to make druids, and you have to compete against other civilizations in order to settle a set amount of druid circles. A forest circle, a desert circle, a swamp circle, a tundra circle and a jungle circle. And I ended up making all the locations necessary (except for swamps, because I didn’t have time to implement rivers), as well as the majority of the UI. I also had the units, the production cycle and I had other civs. However, since I didn’t have time to implement the resources and the enemy AI, and I felt too stressed to figure out what to do to still make the loop work, I ended up only handing in a map generator. So obviously, we won’t win. We didn’t meet any of the requirements!
<br><br>
I have more things to say about the game I had planned out, but first, here is the link to the generator:

Now, this “civclone” game is a fairly shameless copy of civ 6, mixed with elements from Crusader Kings, Stellaris and other similar games. My idea was also to assemble more reusable code I could use for my “Aleastory” project, which would be using a lot of the same things.
